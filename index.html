        Hello!<br>
        My name is Marina.<br> 
        I am a lawyer specializing in civil law.
        Ever since school I liked detective films, 
        investigations and protection of the rights and interests of citizens. 
        Therefore, I gladly went to study law at the largest institute in my region. 
        Particular emphasis was placed on subjects related to civil law, 
        as well as the conduct of business by companies. 
        I also completed my master's degree. 
        A full blown lawyer at your service!

          <br>After my studies, I went to help the citizens of my country seek 
          justice in their everyday and professional activities. 
          I have represented interests in court many times and prepared 
          all the necessary procedural documents.<br>
          In my free time, I study English, web-development (I even made this site myself). 
          I also like playing sports and winning board and computer games. 
          Developing my skills in a race with the skills of the characters!
